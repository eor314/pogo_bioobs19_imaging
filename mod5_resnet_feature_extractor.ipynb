    "# Module 5 - Deep neural networks and feature extraction\n",
    "Neural networks (NN) belong to an entirely different family of learning algorithms called representation learning. Such classifiers learn what they think is most salient about a class directly from the data. Until recently computers were not powerful enough to operate directly on dense data such as images. Instead, researchers used NNs with hand-engineered features as *de facto* feature selectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The past ten years have seen a confluence of advances in computer processing and labeled datasets. Together, these have led to renewed interest and rapid development in NN algorithms. The underlying mechanism remains similar: feed the network labeled examples, see how it does, adjust paramters, and repeat. This process is done many millions of times to tune weights in a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many specific architectures of neural networks. For most of this tutorial we will focus on using *deep residual networks* or ResNets. ResNets are a refinement of general Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) that allow for more efficent training. In essence, there are two distinct phases of a ResNet: feature extraction and classification. The earliest layers of a network are filters that are used to find local regions fitting some pattern in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out, these early fitlers are quite general. That is, they do not change very much regardless of the dataset used for training. We can exploit that fact to use a pre-trained network as a feature extractor. So rather then spending lots of time engineering our our features, we will use a ResNet to pull out the information for us."
